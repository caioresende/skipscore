# skipscore
The Product Store page helps restaurant managers check the ratings on specific products. Imagine that on a specific day, the restaurant sold 50 burgers and 35 salads. The tool will show the overwall rating them and compare to the Skip Score overwall ratings, helping managers take decisions to improve some products or shift focus between them. Maybe the meat was not good or the salad no too fresh on a specific period of time.
